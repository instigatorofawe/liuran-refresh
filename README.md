# Liuran.net (2024 design update)

This is my personal website, which is in essence a portfolio of my publications, technical projects, and writing, along
with links to my professional profiles (Google Scholar, LinkedIn, and GitHub).  

It is a static website written using SvelteKit. Certain demos are run on WebAssembly, compiled from Rust. All
functionality runs client-side. Deployment to GitHub Pages is done using
[`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).
